## ðŸ“Œ Supervised Learning  

Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for predictions. It is divided into two types:  

### ðŸ”¹ Classification  
- **Decision Trees** â€“ [Decision Tree Repo](https://github.com/yuvaranishanthi/DecisionTree)  
- **Random Forest** â€“ [Random Forest Repo](https://github.com/yuvaranishanthi/KNN)  
- **SVM (Support Vector Machines)** â€“ [SVM Repo](https://github.com/yuvaranishanthi/SVM)  
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** â€“ [KNN Repo](https://github.com/yuvaranishanthi/KNN)  
- **Logistic Regression** â€“ [Logistic Regression Repo](https://github.com/yuvaranishanthi/Logistic_Regression)  
- **Naive Bayes** â€“ [Naive Bayes Repo](https://github.com/yuvaranishanthi/NaiveBayes)  
- **Gradient Boosting** â€“ [Gradient Boosting Repo](https://github.com/yuvaranishanthi/Gradient-Boosting)  

### ðŸ”¹ Regression  
- **Linear Regression** â€“ [Linear Regression Repo](https://github.com/yuvaranishanthi/Linear_Regression)

## ðŸ“Œ Unsupervised Learning  

Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to find patterns and relationships.  

### ðŸ”¹ Clustering  
- **K-Means** â€“ [K-Means Repo](https://github.com/yuvaranishanthi/K_Mean-Clustering)  
- **Hierarchical Clustering** â€“ [Hierarchical Clustering Repo](https://github.com/yuvaranishanthi/Hierarchical-Clustering)  
- **DBSCAN** â€“ [DBSCAN Repo](https://github.com/yuvaranishanthi/DBSCAN)  

### ðŸ”¹ Dimensionality Reduction  
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** â€“ [PCA Repo](https://github.com/yuvaranishanthi/PCA)
